Scripts for analyzing next-generation sequencing data using multi-string BWTs ([msBWTs](https://github.com/holtjma/msbwt)).

`batchKmerCounter.py`: given a set of probe files, query an msbwt for each kmer and record the resulting counts
`fastBatchKmerCounter.py`: given a set of probe files, query an msbwt via a fast stack implementation
